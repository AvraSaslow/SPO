# SPO

Facilitates platform for parents to encourage kids to safely bike using an interactive map and leaderboard challenges

Story: ## Inspiration and Design
The Specialized Foundation is heavily invested in increasing accessibility to cycling to aid youth in personal development and education. While they specifically research the effect of cycling with kids who have ADHD, they believe that riding a bike can positively impact anyone's brain.

Thus, it was our goal to create a platform that would encourage kids to ride their bike as a way to develop healthy habits and have fun. SPO specifically creates a cycling relationship between a parent and their child, in which the parent can set bounds on where the child rides, keep track of their location and motivate them to play in the outdoors.

The child portal in the app provides limited information (proximity and direction) about where local "waypoints" are - bike-centric places that a kid finds their way to as a way to complete a challenge. Either individually or with a group, kids can use the app and plan their own routes to waypoints and earn badges when they arrive at the location.

Parents have the ability to set a home location in which their child's travel radius is centered around. They also have the ability to modify the size of the travel radius. The travel radius works as a fixed location parameter in which the parent is alerted if the child leaves the circle as a safety measure.


## Challenges we ran into
We wanted this app to be available across all platforms, so we used Flutter


## Future Implications
As riders ourselves, we understand that learning new skills and excelling at them is one of the most fun parts of riding bikes. We would love to encourage kids to learn new tricks like riding with no hands, learning to wheelie, or riding pump tracks. In the future, we would incorporate accelerometers, gyroscopes, and pressure sensors and preset positional changes that indicate the rider is doing a specific trick. Riders could earn points for doing certain tricks for a certain amount of time.
